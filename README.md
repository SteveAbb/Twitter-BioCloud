# Twitter BioCloud

Twitter BioCloud is a small project that is aimed to paint a picture of a Twitter user by using the Twitter bios of all the accounts a user follows. A word cloud is created that highlights the most commonly used words in all the bios.

## History

I often find myself stumbling upon new Twitter accounts and wondering what that person's intersets are before I follow them. More often than not, Twitter bios alone don't do justice. One day I had the idea of using the bios of all the accounts a user follows to create a word cloud highlighting most commonly used words amongst them all. Based on my limited testing, this has proven to paint quite an accurate picture of a user's true interests.

## Future plans
* Research Twitter's API rate limiting more deeply and see if I can host this web app publicly
